## What am I looking at? 🤔

This repository holds the source code for the [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org) website.

## Getting started ⚡

This repository holds the code for our *legacy* website.
It is what's running on freesewing.org today, but we are working on a new frontend.

For that, please refer to `sites/org` in [our monorepo](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing).

This code is currently maintained, but not actively developed.

## About FreeSewing 💀

Where the world of makers and developers collide, that's where you'll find FreeSewing.

Our [core library](https://freesewing.dev/) is a _batteries-included_ toolbox
for parametric design of sewing patterns. It's a modular system (check our list
of [plugins](https://freesewing.dev/plugins) and getting started is as simple as:

```bash
npx create-freesewing-pattern
```

The [getting started](https://freesewing.dev/guides/getting-started/) section on [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/) is a good
entry point to our documentation, but you'll find a lot more there, including
our [API reference](https://freesewing.dev/reference/api/),
as well as [our tutorial](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/pattern-design/),
and [best practices](https://freesewing.dev/guides/best-practices/).

If you're a maker, checkout [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org) where you can generate
our sewing patterns adapted to your measurements.
